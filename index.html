            My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I<br/>
            found out he was going to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;That it was going to happen<br/>
            soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;That it was real.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I thought about a lot of stuff.<br/>
            Things I hadn't thought about for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I kind<br/>
            of took him for granted or something.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, our parents are<br/>
            just always there.&nbsp;&nbsp;You expect them to always be bugging you<br/>
            to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or<br/>
            try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one<br/>
            day.&nbsp;&nbsp;And make you get up early on the weekend to have<br/>
            "family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me<br/>
            crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't feel that way now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything's different since<br/>
            Dad got his diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I realized that one day in the<br/>
            near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.
